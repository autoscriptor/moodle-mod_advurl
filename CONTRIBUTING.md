## üìã Development Guidelines

### Database Changes

When modifying database schema:

1. **Update `db/install.xml`** for new installations
2. **Add upgrade steps** in `db/upgrade.php`
3. **Test upgrades** from previous versions
4. **Document changes** in the changelog

### Language Strings

All user-facing text must be in language files:

1. **Add strings** to `lang/en/advurl.php`
2. **Use placeholders** (`{$a}`) for dynamic content
3. **Provide context** in help text
4. **Consider translations** - keep strings clear and concise

### Security Considerations

- **Validate all input** from users
- **Escape all output** using Moodle's output functions
- **Check capabilities** before allowing actions
- **Use CSRF protection** for forms
- **Follow Moodle's security guidelines**

### Performance

- **Minimize database queries** - use efficient SQL
- **Cache data** when appropriate
- **Optimize file operations**
- **Consider scalability** for large installations
